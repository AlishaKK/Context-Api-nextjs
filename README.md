**What is the Context API?**

The Context API is a feature in React that allows you to share data (state) across multiple components without having to pass props down through every level of the component tree. It provides a way to manage global state efficiently, making it particularly useful for state that needs to be accessed by many components, such as user authentication info, themes, or shopping cart contents.

**Why Use the Context API?**
Avoid Prop Drilling: It helps to avoid the cumbersome process of passing props through many levels of components.
**Global State Management**: It offers a way to manage and access global state in a React application.
**Simplifies State Sharing**: Makes it easier to share data between components without the need for complex state management libraries.
**Components of the Context API**
**Context**: An object that is created using createContext. It holds the state and functions shared across components.

**Provider**: A component that wraps around parts of your application that need access to the **context**. It uses the value prop to pass down state and functions.

**Consumer**: A component or hook (using useContext) that subscribes to the context, allowing access to the context's value.

**Steps to Follow to Implement the Context API**
**Create Context:**

Use createContext to create a context object.
**Create a Provider:**

Create a provider component that manages the state and provides the context value to its children.
**Wrap Application:**

Wrap your application with the provider, typically in a top-level component like _app.tsx in a Next.js app.
**Consume the Context:**

In any component that needs access to the shared state, use the useContext hook to consume the context.
**Update Context:**

Provide functions within your context to allow components to update the state.
**Quick Example Overview**
Define your context and provider.
Wrap your application with the provider.
Use the context in components to read and update the shared state.
By following these steps, you can effectively utilize the Context API to manage global state in your React application.
